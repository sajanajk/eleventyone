## You're not on Google. Your voice isn't being heard. </br> You're missing out on leads.
## That's where I come in.
## I craft and distribute content that help companies grow exponentially. 

As a copywriter and a content strategist, working predominantly in the PR industry, I know exactly how to create good content as well as how to get that content in front of your audience and get it read. </br>
I also work as a consultant-for-equity for bootstrapping startups.
