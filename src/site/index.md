## I craft and distribute branded content that help companies grow exponentially. 

<i> Yes, content can do that. </i> </br>
As a copywriter and a content strategist, working predominantly in the PR industry, I know exactly how to create good content as well as how to get that content in front of your audience and get it read. </br>
I also work as a consultant-for-equity for bootstrapping startups. </br>
