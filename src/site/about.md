## Basics

I'm a content marketer with almost a decade of experience. Mostly working in the Public Relations sector. I make sure that whatever content goes out there is very good and people actually read them, or at least skim over.

I work part time with publications like NewsWire, Metro Gazette, The Herald, European Union Wire, etc. I have bylines with some of them.
